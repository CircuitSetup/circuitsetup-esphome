openers into your smart home.

## Made for ESPHome
Konnected's products are made with ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers with integrated USB interfaces, and are completely open to end-user servicing
and customization, making them ideal products for ESPHome firmware. Since 2023, Konnected maintains and distributes ESPHome configuration recipies for all
of its products. These configurations are intended to provide out-of-the-box functionality with Home Assistant for the user who prefers a local plug-and-play
solution. More advanced users can import Konnected's ESPHome configuraitons into their ESPHome Dashboard and easily customize, build, and update their
device(s) with a few simple edits of the well-commented configuration files and packages provided by Konnected.
